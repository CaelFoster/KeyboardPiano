heres the figma ^^

52 key keyboard piano

5 octaves 

Changes:

- added OctaveTwo and removed OctaveOne for testing, once this is complete ill be able to import all 6 Octaves

issues:

- the keys arent responsive to the keyboard yet

- notes arent correct 

(everything i do is done in parts on codepen but i get distracted trying to put it on vscode just because its something i need to enviably learn)

Things to do:

- work on my keyboard in figma

- add animations

- Style my piano

Future upgrades:

- parse keyboard piano sheets to create a more in depth learning ui for online piano users

- make the experience more user friendly for new people

- parse MIDI files to output what notes are played, and then print it following the keystrokes on our keyboard ie. if a note is C# and on our piano keyboard the key for C# is capital o then in our parsed midi note file itll print "- o -" along with the BPM for the song 

- add a metronome to the piano

- add a record feature to the piano

- add a play feature to the piano

- add a save feature to the piano

- add a share feature to the piano

- add a download feature to the piano
