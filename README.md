heres the figma ^^

52 key keyboard (currently 56)

issues:

- SVG losing quality when I export it

- SVG elements not being accessed in my JavaScript ( I think its a HTML syntax error )

(everything i do is done in parts on codepen but i get distracted trying to put it on vscode just because its something i need to enviably learn)

Things to do:

- add sounds

- Change how things are targeted // Ill be removing all the extra keys and will be replacing them with Letters both upper and lowercase

- add my piano SVG and change key events accordingly 

- work on my keyboard in figma

- add animations

- Style my piano

Future upgrades:

- parse keyboard piano sheets to create a more in depth learning ui for online piano users

- make the experience more user friendly for new people

- parse MIDI files to output what notes are played, and then print it following the keystrokes on our keyboard ie. if a note is C# and on our piano keyboard the key for C# is capital o then in our parsed midi note file itll print "- o -" along with the BPM for the song 

- more UI
